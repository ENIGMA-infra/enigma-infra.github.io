# Welcome to the ENIGMA-infra FreeSurfer subsegmentations guidelines!

ðŸŽ‰ **Itâ€™s go time!**  
The **subsegmentations pipeline** is now ready to be run! Since youâ€™ve all just been through fMRIPrep in Nipoppy, this next step will feel familiar as running this pipeline follows a very similar workflow.

**About the pipeline:**
This pipeline uses existing FreeSurfer 7 functionalities to extract subnuclei volumes from subcortical regions like the *thalamus*, *hippocampus*, *brainstem*, *hypothalamus*, *amygdala*, and *hippocampus*. It requires completed FreeSurfer output (`recon-all`) and integrates the subsegmentation outputs directly into the existing `/mri` and `/stats` directories. Additionally, the pipeline will perform [Sequence Adaptive Multimodal SEGmentation (SAMSEG)](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/Samseg) on T1w images in order to calculate a superior intracranial volume.

### Pulling the Docker image

You need to download the container image that will run the subsegmentations. Use the following Apptainer command to pull the image from Docker Hub:

```bash
apptainer build freesurfer_subseg_1.0.sif docker://nichyconsortium/freesurfer_subseg:1.0
```

Make sure the resulting image file is placed in the container directory referenced in your global config file.

### Getting the Nipoppy pipeline specification files for this pipeline
To get the Nipoppy specification files for the subsegmentation container, run:
```bash
nipoppy pipeline install --dataset <dataset_root> 15877956
```

Read more about this step [here](../../resources/how_to_guides/getting_ENIGMA-PD_pipeline_config_files.md).

**Note:** If you have multiple T1w images per subject per session, the container will throw an error. In this case, you will need to open the invocation file under `<dataset_root>/pipelines/processing/freesurfer_subseg-1.0/` and specify the name of the desired T1w image for SAMSEG in the following way:
```
"t1_image_path": "[[NIPOPPY_BIDS_PARTICIPANT_ID]]_[[NIPOPPY_BIDS_SESSION_ID]]_<edit-me>_T1w.nii.gz"
```

### Change your global config file
Open the global config file and add the path to your freesurfer license file under the freesurfer_subseg pipeline, just like you did for the fMRIPrep pipeline:

```json
"PIPELINE_VARIABLES": {
  "BIDSIFICATION": {},
  "PROCESSING": {
    "fmriprep": {
      "24.1.1": {
        "FREESURFER_LICENSE_FILE": "path/to/license/file/license.txt",
        "TEMPLATEFLOW_HOME": "path/to/templateflow/"
      }
    },
    "freesurfer_subseg": {
      "1.0": {
        "FREESURFER_LICENSE_FILE": "path/to/license/file/license.txt"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Final check

Before trying to run the pipeline, confirm that the pipeline is recognized by running `nipoppy pipeline list`. This will print a list of the available pipelines.

### Running the pipeline

To run the subsegmentation pipeline, use the following command:

```bash
nipoppy process --pipeline freesurfer_subseg --pipeline-version 1.0 --dataset <dataset_root>
```

### Tracking pipeline output

Use the `nipoppy track-processing` command to check which participants/sessions have complete output:

```bash
nipoppy track-processing --pipeline freesurfer_subseg --dataset <dataset_root>
```

This helps you confirm whether the pipeline ran successfully across your dataset (again, check `processing_status.tsv` under the `derivatives` folder).

### Extracting pipeline output

The pipeline for extraction of data from the subsegmentation is under construction. Stay tuned for updates! You can already extract data from the standard FreeSurfer 7 segementation (see [here](#extract-pipeline-output)) and continue with running the fsqc toolbox as described below.
