Our team implemented Nipoppy in mid-2025 with the intention of contributing our data to the ENIGMA-PD Consortium. We attended an online workshop and followed the ENIGMA-PD Nipoppy implementation guide. We are technically proficient and were able to complete most of the work without any problem. After all, the Nipoppy documentation is quite clear and easy to follow. We did face a minor implementation challenge related to incompatible versions of software packages – this was due to our lab using an older Linux system. This was quickly fixed with help from the Nipoppy team. Nikhil Bhagwat joined us on a zoom call and later happened to be in the region, so attended our institute in Singapore to troubleshoot. Most conventional Linux set-ups should have no such issues. We have found the ENIGMA-PD and Nipoppy teams to be responsive to our queries by email, too. Overall, we did not spend a significant amount of time working on the Nipoppy implementation. Use of Nipoppy has the potential to accelerate our consortium’s progress, so I fully support this initiative.
