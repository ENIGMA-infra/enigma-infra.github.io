As a researcher without prior experience in MRI scan preprocessing or Python-based programming, I found Nipoppy to be an accessible and practical tool. While there were a few obstacles along the way—such as getting the setup just right, as is often the case with these types of projects—the team was always approachable and responsive to questions, and the online instructions were clear. The workshops, combined with practical application and guidance of the team, provided a solid understanding of the pipeline’s structure. This made the process progressively more straightforward. We are now applying the pipeline in another project involving fMRI data, as it offers a structured and reproducible preprocessing workflow that can be readily implemented.
