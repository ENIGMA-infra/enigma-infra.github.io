# **Dr. Shweta Prasad**, NIMHANS, India (Enigma-Tremor)

NIMHANS is a renowned research institute-hospital in Bangalore, India with state-of-the-art scanners and highly-skilled clinicians. With a high-volume of patients, we collect large amounts of scans (>20/month) to be analyzed within a single study. But, typically running advanced analytic pipelines becomes a major challenge for the research projects due to time constraints and technical expertise needed for systematic data management. This is where Nipoppy tools and the ORIGAMI team behind has been a great help! Nipoppy tools are extremely easy to use, they come with extensive documentation and the ORIGAMI team is quick to provide hands-on support. Nipoppy has helped automate our workflows and process large datasets efficiently with many different pipelines. This is especially useful as we are starting to join consortia (ENIGMA-tremor) where consistent and reproducible image processing across sites is critical.
